# Inheritance
The idea of inheritance is central to Object Oriented Programming. Javascript has its own fame in prototypal inheritance. The code samples in the folder named *inheritance* show cases different ways of achieving inheritance behavior (aka behavior delegation) in Javascript.

The following inheritance patterns are illustrated in **inheritance** folder:

| Inheritance variant                            | Sample code                                                                                                                                       |

| *Prototypal Inheritance*                      | [example 1](inheritance/prototypal/prototypal-inheritance.md)         <br/> [example 2](inheritance/prototypal/eventEmitter-Prototypal-Inheritance.md)          |
| *ES6 class based Inheritance*                 | [example 1](inheritance/class/es6-class-inheritance.md)               <br/> [example 2](inheritance/class/eventEmitter-ES6-Class-Inheritance.md)                 |
| *Objects Linked To Other Objects Delegation*  | [example 1](inheritance/object-literal/linked-objects-delegation.md)  <br/> [example 2](inheritance/object-literal/eventEmitter-Linked-Objects-Inheritance.md)   |
