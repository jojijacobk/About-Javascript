# About Javascript

![About Javsacript](https://github.com/jojijacobk/draw.io/raw/master/About%20Javascript.png "About Javascript")

Javascript is a general purpose <span class="underline">scripting
language</span>, which is an implementation of <span
class="underline">ECMAScript specification</span> based on <span
class="underline">ECMA 262 standard</span>.

-   **Ecma International** is an organization that creates standards for
    technologies. They have created several standards for various
    technologies, whereas the standard code named as **ECMA 262**
    defines a <span class="underline">scripting language specification
    called **ECMAScript**</span>.
-   **ECMA 262** is a standard, for example, similar to QWERTY layout
    standard. Every keyboard manufacturers can make their own brand of
    keyboard compliant to QWERTY layout standard. Similarly, the
    specification provided by ECMA 262 standard known
    as ECMAScript provides the rules, standards and guidelines on making
    a scripting language to be considered as ECMAScript compliant.
    ES2015, ES2016 etc are different versions of ECMA 262 standard.
-   A **scripting language** is a programming language designed to act
    specifically on an external entity.  For example Javascript is a
    scripting language targeting at external entities such as browser,
    node.js server etc.
-   Reading _ECMAScript specification_
    helps to understand how to make a scripting language like
    Javascript.
-   Reading _Javascript documentation_
    helps to understand how to use this script language to get things
    done.
-   A **Javascript engine** is a program that understands and executes
    javascript. Eg: _V8 engine for Chrome_,
    _Chakra for Edge_, _SpiderMonkey for FIrefox_
    -   **V8 engine** for Javascript is very fast because the Javascript
        code is directly translated to machine code by V8 by using a
        JIT. There is no intermediate code (interpreted code), hence
        making the execution very fast.
-   The same javascript engine can work on different runtime
    environments. For eg: V8 engine works for Chrome as well as Node.js
    server
-   A **Javascript runtime** is an environment which provides a host of
    objects for javascript to operate on, and is executed by javascript
    engine. So, Browser is a javascript runtime which provides a host of
    objects such as window, document, HTML elements etc which is
    operated on by javascript, and is executed by a javascript engine
    inside this javascript runtime environment. It is the runtime
    environment (browser) that provides the web apis to work on these
    host of objects.

| Language   | Runtime | Engine which executes code |
|------------|---------|----------------------------|
| Java       | JRE     | JVM                        |
| Javascript | Node    | V8                         |
| Javascript | Browser | V8                         |
